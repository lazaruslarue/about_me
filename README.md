# Like hexagons? #

Me too. They're really great shapes and they occur in recent history for all kinds of cool things.

Take a look at the script.js file for some code that I wrote to draw custom polygons (customized for sides on the polygon, interior and exterior radius). Try tinkering with the numbers and refreshing your browser.

Have fun. Enjoy D3.
